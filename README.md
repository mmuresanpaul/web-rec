# web-rec
a small utility to record motion with the default webcam 

## How it works

Using Sarxsos' WEeb API, this app is supposed to be a simple wrapper that can connect to a webcam(default built-in or an auxiliary one) and snap a picture whenever motion is detected. 

The default path, where the pictures are stored, is the home folder of your OS.

Being a simple utility, it is only a CLI. When started, it prompts you with a message whenever motion is detected.
